# Spec — Harness Feedback Loop ("self-tightening harness")

> Epic for the Creance repo itself. The acceptance [reviewer] (`spec-auditor`) grades
> each task against the `US#` acceptance criteria below — bullets are addressable as
> `US1.AC1`, `US1.AC2`, … (the nth bullet under that story).

## Overview

Creance verifies every task but never updates itself based on what verification
found. This epic closes that loop: every gate run leaves a machine-readable
record, escaped defects are back-tested against the auditors and converted into
tightened hunt rules or new invariants, PR bodies are restructured to minimize
human review time (the binding constraint), and the verification machinery
itself is monitored for silent decay. Done means: a project running Creance for
three months has measurably different (tighter) reviewer specs and invariant
checklists than it started with, and can show the evidence trail for each change.

Motivation and provenance: issue #18; adapted from the retrospective-review
technique described in Anthropic's "When AI Builds Itself"
(https://www.anthropic.com/institute/recursive-self-improvement).

## Non-goals

- No model fine-tuning or prompt auto-rewriting — all tightening lands as
  human-reviewed PRs against reviewer specs / `PROJECT.md`, never silently.
- No dashboards or visualization; telemetry is append-only JSONL read by triage.
- No changes to gate semantics (round limits, veto authority, tier floors stay).
- No retroactive sweep of historical defects; the retrospective runs per-incident.
- No tier auto-reassignment from telemetry, and no cross-project telemetry
  aggregation — each project's loop is its own.

## User stories

### US1 — Gate telemetry
As a harness operator, I want every §7 gate run to emit a machine-readable
outcome record, so that auditor behavior and task cost become trends I can
inspect rather than anecdotes.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- AC1: The workflow layer defines a runtime-neutral telemetry record (task ID,
  per-auditor verdict per round, fix-round count, tier dispatched per auditor,
  convergence outcome, timestamp, and — for FAIL verdicts — the verdict report
  text) and names where it is stored via `.claude/PROJECT.md` → "Paths".
- AC2: The Claude Code gate loop produces exactly one record per gate run —
  the loop builds the record payload on every return path, and its dispatcher
  appends it after the run returns (the loop's runtime has no clock or
  filesystem); a failed telemetry write never blocks or fails the gate itself.
- AC3: The guard hook appends a record for every blocked action (rule fired,
  tool, timestamp) to the same telemetry location, plus an evaluation record
  on at least one path guaranteed to fire during every gate run (e.g., the
  strong-tier floor check on the constitution-auditor dispatch), so guard
  liveness is distinguishable from "nothing to block"; logging failures never
  change guard exit behavior.
- AC4: Guard regression tests cover both logging paths (block records and
  evaluation records), including the failure-stays-silent case.

### US2 — Triage trend surfacing
As a harness operator, I want the morning triage snapshot to surface telemetry
trends, so that recurring auditor failures and discovered-work clusters point
me at misplaced boundaries and missing specs.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- AC1: The triage snapshot includes a "Gate trends" section: FAIL counts by
  auditor over the snapshot window, tasks that hit the non-convergence stop,
  and tier-escalation events.
- AC2: The triage snapshot includes a "Discovered-work clusters" section
  grouping open discovered-work issues by subsystem/path, flagging any cluster
  of 3+ as a possible missing spec.
- AC3: The "Gate trends" section is read-only over telemetry (never writes or
  mutates it) and renders an explicit "no data yet" state when no telemetry
  exists, rather than erroring or being silently omitted.
- AC4: The "Discovered-work clusters" section is read-only and renders an
  explicit empty state when no open discovered-work issues exist, rather than
  erroring or being silently omitted.

### US3 — Retrospective back-test
As a harness operator, when a defect or constitution violation is found on the
base branch, I want a retrospective workflow that re-runs the auditors against
the historical diff that introduced it, so that every escape converts into a
tightened hunt rule, a new invariant row, or a documented known-gap.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- AC1: A runtime-neutral workflow doc defines the retrospective: input is a
  commit/PR reference plus defect description; the auditors are dispatched
  read-only against that historical diff exactly as the gate would have run
  them.
- AC2: The retrospective classifies the outcome as one of: WOULD-HAVE-CAUGHT
  (auditors FAIL the historical diff and the gate was skipped or misconfigured
  for that change), INCONSISTENT-CATCH (auditors FAIL it now but the gate ran
  and passed — nondeterminism, or rules tightened since), HUNT-RULE-GAP
  (auditors still pass it under current rules), or INVARIANT-GAP (nothing
  documented covers the defect), with file:line evidence.
- AC3: For HUNT-RULE-GAP and INVARIANT-GAP, the retrospective produces a
  proposed edit (reviewer spec change or invariant checklist row) as a normal
  PR through the standard issue/branch/gate flow — it never edits rules
  directly.
- AC4: The constitution auditor runs at strong tier in retrospectives, same
  floor the guard enforces for gate runs.
- AC5: A Claude Code skill binding exposes the workflow, which dispatches the
  existing reviewer roles read-only — no new binding-contract role is created —
  and dispatches the constitution auditor at or above the strong-tier floor
  (AC4), so the binding itself is reviewed against the floor, not just the
  workflow doc.
- AC6: A conformance probe for the retrospective workflow is added and passes
  on the live adapter, with results recorded.

### US4 — Risk-ranked PR digest
As a human reviewer, I want every PR body to lead with a risk-ranked digest of
what the gate found, so that my scarce review time goes to the riskiest parts
of the diff instead of re-deriving them from raw verdicts.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- AC1: The PR body template in the next-task workflow leads with a digest:
  near-misses (anything FAILed then fixed), all JUSTIFY items quoted verbatim,
  invariants the diff touched, and 1–3 recommended human focus areas with
  file:line references.
- AC2: Every digest claim links to or quotes the auditor verdict text it came
  from — live verdicts on the PR, or the telemetry-retained FAIL report text
  for near-misses (US1.AC1); the digest contains no maker self-assessment that
  lacks a verdict source.
- AC3: Verbatim verdicts remain on the PR as the per-reviewer comments the
  next-task workflow already specifies, unmodified; the digest leads the PR
  body and links to them.

### US5 — Verification-machinery freshness
As a harness operator, I want triage to detect when the guard or probe results
have gone stale, so that a silently dead guard is surfaced in days, not
discovered by the next adapter port.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- AC1: Probe runs record a fingerprint (content hash) of the guard script and
  the hook wiring (settings matcher) alongside their results.
- AC2: Triage flags PROBES-STALE when the current fingerprint differs from the
  last recorded probe run, and reports the age of the last probe run.
- AC3: Triage flags GUARD-SILENT when telemetry shows zero guard *evaluation*
  records (US1.AC3) over a window in which gate runs occurred (heuristic,
  reported as a warning not an error).
