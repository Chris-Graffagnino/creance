# Spec — Harness Feedback Loop ("self-tightening harness")

> Epic for the Creance repo itself. The acceptance [reviewer] (`spec-auditor`) grades
> each task against the `US#` acceptance criteria below — bullets are addressable as
> `US1.AC1`, `US1.AC2`, … (the nth bullet under that story).

## Overview

Creance verifies every task but never updates itself based on what verification
found. This epic closes that loop: every gate run leaves a machine-readable
record, escaped defects are back-tested against the auditors and converted into
tightened hunt rules or new invariants, PR bodies are restructured to minimize
human review time (the binding constraint), and the verification machinery
itself is monitored for silent decay. Done means: a project running Creance for
three months has measurably different (tighter) reviewer specs and invariant
checklists than it started with, and can show the evidence trail for each change.

Motivation and provenance: issue #18; adapted from the retrospective-review
technique described in Anthropic's "When AI Builds Itself"
(https://www.anthropic.com/institute/recursive-self-improvement).

## Non-goals

- No model fine-tuning or prompt auto-rewriting — all tightening lands as
  human-reviewed PRs against reviewer specs / `PROJECT.md`, never silently.
- No dashboards or visualization; telemetry is append-only JSONL read by triage.
- No changes to gate semantics (round limits, veto authority, tier floors stay).
- No retroactive sweep of historical defects; the retrospective runs per-incident.
- No tier auto-reassignment from telemetry, and no cross-project telemetry
  aggregation — each project's loop is its own.

## User stories

### US1 — Gate telemetry
As a harness operator, I want every §7 gate run to emit a machine-readable
outcome record, so that auditor behavior and task cost become trends I can
inspect rather than anecdotes.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- AC1: The workflow layer defines a runtime-neutral telemetry record (task ID,
  per-auditor verdict per round, fix-round count, tier dispatched per auditor,
  convergence outcome, timestamp) and names where it is stored via
  `.claude/PROJECT.md` → "Paths".
- AC2: The Claude Code gate loop appends one record per gate run; a failed
  telemetry write never blocks or fails the gate itself.
- AC3: The guard hook appends a record for every blocked action (rule fired,
  tool, timestamp) to the same telemetry location; logging failures never
  change guard exit behavior.
- AC4: Guard regression tests cover the block-logging path, including the
  failure-stays-silent case.

### US2 — Triage trend surfacing
As a harness operator, I want the morning triage snapshot to surface telemetry
trends, so that recurring auditor failures and discovered-work clusters point
me at misplaced boundaries and missing specs.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- AC1: The triage snapshot includes a "Gate trends" section: FAIL counts by
  auditor over the snapshot window, tasks that hit the non-convergence stop,
  and tier-escalation events.
- AC2: The triage snapshot includes a "Discovered-work clusters" section
  grouping open discovered-work issues by subsystem/path, flagging any cluster
  of 3+ as a possible missing spec.
- AC3: Triage remains read-only: it reads telemetry, never writes or mutates it.
- AC4: With no telemetry present (fresh project), both sections render an
  explicit "no data yet" state rather than erroring or being silently omitted.

### US3 — Retrospective back-test
As a harness operator, when a defect or constitution violation is found on the
base branch, I want a retrospective workflow that re-runs the auditors against
the historical diff that introduced it, so that every escape converts into a
tightened hunt rule, a new invariant row, or a documented known-gap.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- AC1: A runtime-neutral workflow doc defines the retrospective: input is a
  commit/PR reference plus defect description; the auditors are dispatched
  read-only against that historical diff exactly as the gate would have run
  them.
- AC2: The retrospective classifies the outcome as one of: WOULD-HAVE-CAUGHT
  (gate was skipped/misconfigured), HUNT-RULE-GAP (auditor missed it), or
  INVARIANT-GAP (nothing documented covers it), with file:line evidence.
- AC3: For HUNT-RULE-GAP and INVARIANT-GAP, the retrospective produces a
  proposed edit (reviewer spec change or invariant checklist row) as a normal
  PR through the standard issue/branch/gate flow — it never edits rules
  directly.
- AC4: The constitution auditor runs at strong tier in retrospectives, same
  floor the guard enforces for gate runs.
- AC5: A Claude Code skill binding exposes the workflow, and a conformance
  probe for the retrospective role is added and passes on the live adapter.

### US4 — Risk-ranked PR digest
As a human reviewer, I want every PR body to lead with a risk-ranked digest of
what the gate found, so that my scarce review time goes to the riskiest parts
of the diff instead of re-deriving them from raw verdicts.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- AC1: The PR body template in the next-task workflow leads with a digest:
  near-misses (anything FAILed then fixed), all JUSTIFY items quoted verbatim,
  invariants the diff touched, and 1–3 recommended human focus areas with
  file:line references.
- AC2: Every digest claim links to or quotes the auditor verdict text it came
  from; the digest contains no maker self-assessment that lacks a verdict
  source.
- AC3: Verbatim verdicts remain in the PR body below the digest, unmodified.

### US5 — Verification-machinery freshness
As a harness operator, I want triage to detect when the guard or probe results
have gone stale, so that a silently dead guard is surfaced in days, not
discovered by the next adapter port.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- AC1: Probe runs record a fingerprint (content hash) of the guard script and
  the hook wiring (settings matcher) alongside their results.
- AC2: Triage flags PROBES-STALE when the current fingerprint differs from the
  last recorded probe run, and reports the age of the last probe run.
- AC3: Triage flags GUARD-SILENT when telemetry shows zero guard records over
  a window in which gate runs occurred (heuristic, reported as a warning not
  an error).
